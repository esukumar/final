<p>Welcome to Centurion Travel Blogs! This Web App is targeted for a traveler
who wants to document his/her adventures. Once you navigate to the home
page, you have a few options. The casual browser can click on the Events
tab to view other Users&#39; travels. Events are supposed to be individual
trips, and they are listed in alphabetical order. You can search for a
particular trip by using the Search box. Once an <a
href="Event.html">Event</a> has been selected, all the Notes and Images for
the <a href="Event.html">Event</a> will be listed in chronological order.
The Activities that took place at the <a href="Event.html">Event</a> are
also listed on the page. The casual browser can also click on the
Activities tab to view a list of all activities that have taken place. You
can select a particular <a href="Activity.html">Activity</a> to see whether
it exists in multiple Events. To enable further functionality of the App,
you must sign up / sign in. To sign up, click on the Sign Up link, and fill
out your email address, password, and name. None of the fields can be
blank, and the email address must contain the “@” symbol. Once you have
successfully signed up, click on the Sign In link and enter your email
address and password. You can now access another tab called Profile that
will list your personal details and Events. You can also delete your
account from here. When you navigate back to the Events tab, you will now
see an option to Add an <a href="Event.html">Event</a>. For your personal
Events, you can create Notes, post your own Images, and add new <a
href="Event.html">Event</a> Activities. You can also add comments for any
Notes/Images on any <a href="Event.html">Event</a>. You are allowed to
delete anything that you have created, but you may not delete other
Users&#39; posts. Finally, you can sign out of your account and redirect to
the home page. We hope that this becomes your new favorite App for blogging
all of your adventure travels!</p>
